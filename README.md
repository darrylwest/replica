## Overview

Replica is a file watching and replication service that monitors files on a server or laptop and distributes the files to
various target servers.  It is commonly used for simple remote backup but can also be used to develop multi-platform
targets with instant compile and test feedback.

## Usage

```
replica  \
  --sources src,include,test \
  --extensions .hpp,.cpp \
  --excludes 'cxxopts.hpp,fmt/,catch.hpp,.git,/build/' \
  --cmd make`
```

### Replica Ticker Loop

_TBD_

## CMake

This project is based on manual editing of CMakeFiles.txt to comply with src/library/test/build folder structure.  Development 
is enabled for CLion but can be done in vim, vscode, or any editor.

## Branches

* main branch: this is the distribution branch.
* develop branch: this is the primary development branch.  It's merged to main usually through pull requests.

_Custom branches are also available for specific builds_

## Package Management (_future_)

[CPM?](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake)

## Data Structs

* Config
* FileSpec

## Notes

* cpp 20
* build and tested for linux (debian) with gcc 10.2 and mac with clang 13
* structs and closures but no classes

## Dependencies

std=c++20
CMake 3.16
Debian 11, gcc 10
osX 12, Apple Clang 13.0.0, darwin 21.3

_TODO : write a script to pull, build and install all deps to an internal (or cached) deps folder..._

* [ ] fmt/format - download, build and install
* [ ] spdlog - download, build and install
* [ ] threads - available with gcc
* [ ] cxxopts.hpp - in the include folder
* [ ] catch2 - included in test folder
* [ ] json - nlohmann-json ; brew install nlohmann-json ; debian: download, build and install

_Future dependencies for multi-machine implementations, backups, etc._

* [ ] openssl - install
* [ ] boost - v1.74 ; apt-get install libboost-all-dev / brew install boost

_Consider using [message-pack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/cpp_master) to replace/augment json encoding..._
